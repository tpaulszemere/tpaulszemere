# 👋 Hi, I'm T. Paul  
### **PhD Economist | Behavioral Pricing & Decision Science | AI/ML in Progress | Former University Lecturer**

## 🧠 About Me
I’m a PhD economist specializing in **behavioral pricing, risk perception, and decision science** across B2B and B2C contexts.  
For over **10 years**, I worked as a **researcher and university lecturer**, teaching:

- Microeconomics  
- Macroeconomics  
- Decision Theory  
- Behavioral Economics  
- Risk and Uncertainty Analysis  

My academic work explored **how individuals and organizations evaluate risk, value, and trust**, and how past experiences (including stress & trauma) shape decision-making.

Today I am transitioning into **AI & Machine Learning**, focusing on integrating behavioral insights into predictive systems, pricing intelligence, and decision-optimization models.

# 🚀 Current Focus
- Building an AI/ML portfolio in **Python & PyTorch**
- Behavioral pricing intelligence models  
- Risk prediction for B2B/B2C markets  
- Modeling trust-sensitive decisions  
- Behavioral simulation tools  
- Applied ML for health & behavioral economics
